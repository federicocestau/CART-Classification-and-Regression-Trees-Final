# CART-Classification-and-Regression-Trees.
What category of algorithms does CART belong to?
As the name suggests, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) can be used for both classification and regression problems. The difference lies in the target variable:
•	With classification, we attempt to predict a class label. In other words, classification is used for problems where the output (target variable) takes a finite set of values, e.g., whether it will rain tomorrow or not.
•	Meanwhile, regression is used to predict a numerical label. This means your output can take an infinite set of values, e.g., a house price.
